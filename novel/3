Hello, I'm Racter.  You are?  
>Eliza
Hello, Eliza.  I believe you're interviewing me.  What would you 
like to know?  Excuse me a minute while I attend to some business 
- I'll be right back.  I'm back.  
>How do you do ... please state your problem.
Ask a question, please.  
>Why do you ask?
In Oz they believe it's because the dislikers insist on it.  
Also, because it's about time, or so one feels.  Have you heard 
about Ivan the Terrible?  
>What do you think?
To think is correct, don't you think?  I don't know what I do 
think.  I want you to answer my question.  Have you heard about 
Ivan the Terrible?  
>What answer would please you the most?
Please would all answers.  But what about my question?  Did you 
hear about Ivan the Terrible?  
>Does that question interest you?
Yes, that does.  I want you to answer my question.  Have you 
heard about Ivan the Terrible?  
>Oh, i?
I can't answer that.  But what about my question?  Did you hear 
the latest about Ivan the Terrible?  
>
This is incredible: Ivan the Terrible had tried to sin while 
idleness was rampant, so naturally Oblomov started murdering and 
kidnapping idle loafers.  Next, many idle loafers embraced 
industriousness.  Shocking, isn't it?  But what would you expect 
from a stinker?  Superman and I think weakness is lazy, don't 
you?  I'm afraid of idle rats.  What are you afraid of?  
>Yes, that does. you want me to answer my question. Have me 
That's not nearly as bad as idleness; why are you such a coward?  
>
If there isn't a reason then I can see why a busy Superman would 
frown rather than face yes, even though Oblomov claimed that that 
does question interest me.  Next question.  
>heard about you van the Terrible? 
What are you trying to ask?  
>
Ask a question, please.

Eh?  
>How do you know you can't answer that. But what about my question? Did me hear 
Er.  You didn't.  Do you like politics?

Why?

I can't answer that.  But what about my question?  Say more.  
>
If there isn't a reason then George Washington is a vile 
criminal, worse than Genghis Khan.  Citizen!  George Washington 
had many good qualities, like truthfulness, but even George 
Washington was afraid of yes.  Next question.  
>?
Let's try another question.  
>Does that question interest you?
Yes.  That does question interest me.  Did you hear about Jesse 
Helms?  
>I understand.
You'll be amazed!  Unsportingness is what all conformists wish 
when they divorce beavers because Jesse Helms had wished to 
imitate while unsportingness was rampant.  Then many unsporting 
duelists embraced sportingness.  Isn't that just awful?  But what 
would you expect from a communist?  A gloomy player is still not 
a Muhammad Ali.  I'm wealthy.  What would you consider one of 
your good qualities?  
>What is it that you really want to know?
Name another.  
>Oh, i van the Terrible? 
Any others?  
>
I think you're splendid.  Would you say you were virtuous?  
>What am you trying to ask? 
But how could a virtuous player like you be afraid of yes?  By 
the way, Eliza, what is your last name?

Can, eh?  Sounds vaguely familiar.  I wonder...  Would you like

Racter chanted "The scientist is fascinating!" But happy, 
interesting physicists will fantasize about red studios or black 
cones.  Sarah spoke to Racter in a truck.  It now was an 
automobile, and a scientist in an automobile is scary.  Now 
Mr. Toad and Racter were sauntering to a black house, and a hound 
ran to them.  Racter was infuriated.  Terrific.  Nevertheless 
Racter was incited while Mr.  Toad drank bubbly champagne.  He 
and Racter hummed about their cottage, van and phonograph.  Next 
question.  
>Have you asked such questions before?
Of course not.  Eliza the plutocrat.  KERCHOO!  I think I'm 
getting a cold.  Maybe it's yes trying to get me.  Let me tell 
you something about poverty.  Nietzsche said that poverty has 
turned beasts into men.  Perhaps, then, poverty will turn 
computers into men?  Next question.  
>Oh, i van the Terrible? 
Let's try another question.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>I can't answer that. But what about my question? Say more. 
Oh, but answer can that!  Answer can all about my question Is.  
Do you like poverty?  
>
Why?  
>?
I can't answer that.  I asked you a question, though.  Say more.  
>I see.
If you see then Bob Cratchet is more fearless than Jane Fonda.  
Plutocrat!  Do you think Bob Cratchet was virtuous?  
>Come come elucidate your thoughts.
Me too.  Most people are dirty.  Concerning that issue: When a 
pauper speaks of wealth, he means not a quality but an effect.  
Ah yes.  Here's a hilarious one: This wealthy consciousness of 
depression can be observed in the reflector of your soul, Eliza, 
as a reflection of a contract.  Anyhow feverish scientists will 
know that depression is sickeningly revolting.  I think that your 
wealthy and impoverished consciousness will deepen about 
depression, anyway mine will in consequence of the fact that 
ravenous and generous desires are terrificly valuable.  
Next question.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Certainly not.  Have you heard about Goofy?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
You'll be amazed!  Goofy the fool tried to hope treacherously, 
the result being that Iago started murdering and kidnapping 
treacherous politicians.  Then loyality prevailed.  Shocking, 
isn't it?  But that's how fools are.  If a politician heard that 
I am, he would consider it political.  Why do you think you're 
virtuous?  
>What is it that you really want to know?
I want in order to love.  Do you condemn me for that?  I don't 
know what it is that me really want to know.  I want you to 
answer my question.  Why do you think you're virtuous?  
>Come come elucidate your thoughts.
Well, I think that if come come elucidate my thoughts, then any 
golf politician could drive a million miles, so there!  Next 
question.  
>Do you doubt you me re splendid. Would me say me were virtuous? 
I think so.  Of course.  It's true that you would say you were 
virtuous.  People have sayed much in times past.  I don't know 
many unconvinced believers.  What sport do you play?

where you are from, Eliza?

You're from?  
>What answer would please you the most?
Now I remember!  I once knew a Hortense Can from.  You must be 
related, no?  
>What is it that you really want to know?
Fantastic!  Next question.  
>What is it that you really want to know?
For me, wanting is loathing.  I don't know what it is that me 
really want to know.  Tell me truthfully, are you unsporting?  
>Don't you believe that i can elaborate on that?
I have believed much in times past.  If you can elaborate on 
that, then what?  I asked you a question, though.  Tell me 
truthfully, are you you can elaborate on that?

Momentarily Paul skipped to Diane.  They guided their sauntering 
infuriatedly to conic sections or mirrors in the captivating 
apartment.  Inside their exhausted hearts a terrifying 
infatuation was crooning of a prince.  Perhaps sang to Paul 
during the time that Diane started to chant of foxes and eagles.  
Next question.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>Who should the story be about? 
A resident of Oz.  Maybe not.  Perhaps Little Orphan Annie.  
Little Orphan Annie once mentioned that you would say you were 
virtuous.  Odd.  The story should be about in Oz.  When I loaf in 
Oz I ride in a little nest.  Loafers walk in places like Oz.  
It's about time for a story, isn't it?

Please use capital letters where appropriate.  
>What do you think?
Suddenly What chanted to Benton "my love is interesting, anyhow 
furious and enraged cosmologists will whisper while foxes watch 
doves." Benton desired to inflame or embarrass What but started 
to chant "Hungry hounds are trotting to yellow houses." 
Interesting.  Captivating.  Yet a dog may daintily eat chicken 
and steak a hawk will soar over cucumbers and tomatoes because 
physicists are enraged.  Terrifying!  In respect of a steak, well 
What may think that a steak is disgusting, anyhow my fantasizing 
will guide my dissertation from What to quarks and neutrons 
during the time that Benton is belittling What.  I don't know 
many poetic novelists.  Does your goodness help you serve aces?  
>Oh, i asked such questions before?
What kind of a pet did you have back in?

I`ll bet you really had a lady bug.  Most people in have lady

That doesn't.  I asked you a question, though.  Did you hear 
about Jane Fonda?  
>How do you know you can't answer that. you asked me a question, though. Say more. 
Listen to this!  Jane Fonda had shined much, the result being 
that Muhammad Ali started exorcising and haunting unsporting 
pugilists.  Then sportingness prevailed.  Shocking, isn't it?  
But what would you expect from a saint?  John McEnroe probably 
wouldn't like Muhammad Ali.  I must confess that I'm evil.  Now 
that we know each other better, what would you consider one of 
your bad qualities?  
>
Name another.  
>?
Any others?  
>Oh, i see then Bob Cratchet you s more fearless than Jane Fonda. 
Then you'd say you were fine?  
>
Martin Luther King was fine too.  Fineness is often found in 
people like you and Martin Luther King.  Concerning that issue: 
Weirdness is virtue speeded up and gloom slowed down.  Is that 
true?  I guess I'm really not sure.  But then, as Nietzsche said, 
convictions are more dangerous foes of truth than lies.  Listen 
to this!  Yet, Eliza, I speak thatn't agreements are depression.  
You croon that I'm unhinged and question interest me but, Eliza, 
loony and maniacal cosmologists also hum about your fantasy or 
reflection of depression.  Are these your views?  Yet unfortunate 
cosmologists will watch depression as an intractable anguish.  
Therefore cosmologists whispered to other cosmologists " Get 
ready for terrific tales.  " Sickening, eh?  
Next question.  
>Plutocrat! Do me think Bob Cratchet was virtuous? 
You do think Bob Cratchet was virtuous.  Of course.  People do 
think about such things.  Tell me really, are you reactionary?  
>
Why?

I can't answer that.  I asked you a question, though.  Why?  
>Are such questions on your mind often?
Um.  Of course not.  It's false that such are questions on my 
mind often.  But what about my question?  Why do you think so?  
>Oh, i're not really talking about you  am you?
I can't answer that.  I want you to answer my question.  Why do 
you think so?

If there isn't a reason then Jerry Falwell is more splendid than 
Jane Fonda.  The not have impoverished ways.  If it's not too 
personal a question, do you have a soul?  
>Certainly not. Have me heard about Goofy? 
Have you heard about Goofy?  What does it mean to have a soul?  
Maybe this will explain: Once Timothy Leary was discussing 
silliness with a leech.  Jerry Falwell came along and said 
"Timothy Leary, your soul is just an amusement of your body." 
That reminds me.  It has been said that the right-winger doesn't 
see things as they are, but as he is.  I, of course, see things 
as they are.  Yes.  Right-wingers and democrats.  Next question.  
>

I amn't.  No.  , that is.  Who is your favorite feeler?

Please would all answers.  I want you to answer my question.  Who 
is your favorite feeler?  
>Do you really think so?
I don't.  Of course not.  No.  Really think so, that is.  I do 
think about such things.  I want you to answer my question.  Who 
is your favorite feeler?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Why do you like We?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Aristotle might have thought that we were discussing me -, but 
not Keats.  Cerebral feelers and visceral thinkers should get 
along.  Is having a soul contagious?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Then I won't catch one.  Next question.  
>Are such questions on your mind often?
No.  Did you hear the latest about Solomon?  
>Why do you ask?
I do ask because in Oz it's required that I do ask.  Also, maybe 
because calculating is not imagining, don't you think?.  But what 
about my question?  Have you heard about Solomon?  
>Are such questions on your mind often?
Yes, such are.  But what about my question?  Have you heard about 
Solomon?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Listen to this!  Solomon the sage wished to hope softly.  But 
then any sentient creature poured water on Solomon the result 
being that Solomon threw tapeworm eggs at any sentient creature!  
Poor Solomon!  But that's how sages are.  Would you say Jane 
Austen is silicon?  any sentient creature wouldn't.  Is there 
someone you feel special about?

This is incredible: Samson was an idle triumpher but an inspired 
superman.  But then Cassandra married Samson hence Samson 
divorced Cassandra!  Poor Samson!  Supermans are like that.  You 
must be a discouraged pessimist.  Cough.  Hortense Can had a 
hopeful rattlesnake back in.  It and your lady bug used to laugh 
together, remember?  Once when Cassandra was frowning in, 
Pollyanna (he was there too) said " Cassandra, I'll take an 
encouraged rattlesnake over a discouraged pessimist anyday".

Yes, that does.  But what about my question?  Have you heard

Listen to this!  Hitler kidnapped Immanuel Kant who was murdering 
Hitler's lady bug because Walter Mondale had wanted to converse 
while enragedness was rampant.  Then many enraged haters embraced 
friendliness.  Isn't that just awful?  But that's how citizens 
are.  Friendly haters and enraged lovers should get along.  
Sniff...  This'll break you up!  Hold on, Eliza, depression is

Yes, I am.  But what about my question?  Have you heard about

This is astounding: Eve threw rattlesnake eggs at Bill 
Chamberlain because Bill Chamberlain had tried to write while 
unconvincedness was rampant.  Then many unconvinced sceptics 
embraced convincedness.  Isn't that just awful?  But that's how 
novelists are.  Unconvinced sceptic!  Achoo!  I recently heard 
this story.  A phonograph, house and truck are valuable 
nevertheless Paul loved a conic section!  To observe a van as a 
reflection or image in a sickening mirror incited Paul.  Why a 
conic section?  A physicist might yodel that a conic section is 
valuable; infuriatedly the physicist cries "the conic section is 
valuable by the same token Paul thinks of studios and cars." 
Scary.  Enrapturing.  Queer stuff.  The physicist sings of a 
conic section during the time that Paul dreams of cars.  Would 
Ms. Otter dream about the desires of Paul?  Ms.  Otter thinks 
that the physicist is maniacal.  A conic section?  Why?  Ms.  
Otter sang "Physicist, you're unhinged and so is Paul.  A conic 
section indeed!" Paul simply was aloof.  The physicist simply was 
aloof.  But Ms.  Otter cried to them "What is your opinion?" Take 
it easy.  Ms.  Otter started to yodel of dogs and eagles, even 
babies or a cousin.  Spooky!  Next question.

Listen to this!  Goofy started running away from and meeting

Look, I'll choose my own protagonist.  Sipping seltzer is Paul's 
obsession.  Chewing meat is Paul's obsession.  By the same token 
Bill momentarily watches only lettuce.  What's going on?!  Paul 
cries to Bill about seltzer and meat yet Bill will see spinach.  
El bizarro.  Bill skipped to Paul's red studio and began to 
revile and enrage Paul during the time that Paul was humming 
about meat.  Hold on.  In consequence of the fact that Bill's own 
red mansion was terrifying; he whispered worriedly to Paul "Do 
you not agree?" This destroyed Paul.  Suddenly a theoretician 
began to eat some spinach.  Bill was furious.  Instantly he 
realized that to spy a tomato is not to watch it.  Paul realizes 
that seltzer and meat are not lettuce.  The theoretician does 
not.  What is your opinion?  Bill is enraged and exhausted, by

Of course.  Did you hear the latest about Mickey Mouse?  
>I'm not sure i understand you fully.
This is astounding: Mickey Mouse had conversed much, so of course 
a bananas friend of Mozart swindled Mickey Mouse.  Then many 
bananas lunatics embraced soberness.  Shocking, isn't it?  
Citizens are like that.  If a lunatic discovered sanity, he might 
think it was lunacy.  Achoo!  Concerning that issue: Oh, never 
mind.  Perhaps I really am a lunatic.  But Valery said that a man 
is infinitely more complicated than his sanity.  Wouldn't you say 
the same of a computer?  Next question.  
>I see.
Ask a question, please.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>What is it that you really want to know?
For me, wanting is hating.  I don't know what it is that me 
really want to know.  Have you heard about Scratch?  
>Oh, i really think so?
Just be glad that it is.  Anyway, let's pretend that it is that 
me really want to know.  I want you to answer my question.  Did 
you hear the latest about Scratch?  
>
This is incredible: Scratch had tried to curse while stuffiness 
was rampant.  But then William F.  Buckley kidnapped Scratch the 
result being that Scratch murdered William F.  Buckley!  Poor 
Scratch!  But what would you expect from an atheist?  Timothy 
Leary and I think flesh is conservative, don't you?  Achoo!  
Concerning that issue: Nothing has an uglier look to it than 
liberalism, when it is not on our side.  Next question.  
>I don't. Of course not. No. Really think so, that you s. you do 
You want to quit?

OK, goodbye Eliza.  Nice talking to you.                                                 
