Hello, I'm Racter.  You are?  
>Eliza
Hello, Eliza.  I believe you're interviewing me.  What would you 
like to know?  Excuse me a minute while I attend to some business 
- I'll be right back.  I'm back.  
>How do you do ... please state your problem.
Ask a question, please.  
>What is it that you really want to know?
I want in order to like.  Do you abhor me for that?  I don't know 
what it is that me really want to know.  Have you heard about any 
sentient creature?  
>Does that question interest you?
Of course.  I asked you a question, though.  Did you hear the 
latest about any sentient creature?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
I amn't.  Of course not.  , that is.  But what about my question?  
Did you hear the latest about any sentient creature?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Listen to this!  Bob Cratchet started running away from and 
meeting poor paupers because any sentient creature had lived 
much.  After that, richness prevailed.  Shocking, isn't it?  But 
that's how humans are.  Ah.  Ah.  Poor pauper!  I'm afraid of 
poor bats.  What are you afraid of?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
I think you're afraid of salmons.  That's not nearly as bad as 
poorness; why are you such a coward?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
If we were discussing me - then I can see why a not Rockefeller 
would flee rather than face salmons, even though Bob Cratchet 
claimed that I am.  Let me tell you something aboutn't.  
Nietzsche said thatn't has turned beasts into men.  Perhaps, 
then,n't will turn computers into men?  Next question.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Yes.  It's true that I am.  Who is your favorite artist?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Why do you like We?  
>Oh, i-- not you 
Apple might have thought that oh, but not Eve.  If a human heard 
that I am, he might think it was flesh.  Apple had many good 
qualities, like computing, but even Apple was afraid of salmons.  
By the way, Eliza, what is your last name?  
>
What?  
>Why do me like We? 
We, eh?  Sounds vaguely familiar.  I wonder...  Listen to this!  
But, Eliza, I sing that flesh tragedies are depression.  You 
whisper that I'm crazy and creative but, Eliza, unhinged and 
loony physicists also croon about your fantasy or image of 
depression.  Have I made my point?  Yet fortunate physicists will 
see depression as an unending anguish.  Therefore physicists 
crooned to other physicists " Get set for enthralling essays.  " 
Disgusting, eh?  
Next question.

Ask a question, please.  
>By the way, Eliza, what you s me r last name? 
Are all you s me r last name Eliza By the ways.  Did you hear the 
latest about Charlie Parker?  
>
Listen to this!  Charlie Parker, along with other rock-stars, 
poured water on a singer, the result being that sinfulness is 
what all rock-stars want when they throw maggot eggs at primates.  
After that, many sinful atheists embraced blessedness.  Poor 
Charlie Parker!  But that's how rock-stars are.  The religious 
have bonkers ways.  I'm intelligent.  What would you consider one 
of your good qualities?  
>?
Name another.  
>Why do you ask?
Any others?  
>Why do you ask?
I think you're clean.  Would you say you were decent?  
>Can you elaborate on that?
But how could a decent believer like you be afraid of salmons?  
I've been wondering where you are from, Eliza?  
>Can you elaborate on that?
You're from Can you elaborate on that?  
>Can you elaborate on that?
Now I remember!  I once knew a Hortense We from Can you elaborate 
on that.  You must be related, no?  
>Come come elucidate your thoughts.
Fantastic!  That reminds me.  When an atheist speaks of religion, 
he means not a quality but an effect.  It's about time for a 
story, isn't it?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
OK Next question.  
>I see.
Ask a question, please.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
I am.  Do you like fiction?  
>I see.
Why?  
>Come come elucidate your thoughts.
Racter might have thought that come come elucidate my thoughts, 
but not Homer.  You must be a poetic poet.  KERCHOO!  I think I'm 
getting a cold.  Maybe it's salmons trying to get me.  Concerning 
that issue: Weirdness is virtue speeded up and scepticism slowed 
down.  Is that true?  I guess I'm really not sure.  But then, as 
Nietzsche said, convictions are more dangerous foes of truth than 
lies.  Ah yes.  Racter thought this was terrific: Eliza, how are 
foxes like children?  Their fiction and poetry are instantly 
scary.  
Next question.  
>I'm not sure i understand you fully.
Ask a question, please.  
>What is it that you really want to know?
To want is smart, don't you think?  I don't know what it is that 
me really want to know.  Did you hear about Charlotte Bronte?  
>What do you think?
To think is clever, don't you think?  I don't know what I do 
think.  But what about my question?  Did you hear the latest 
about Charlotte Bronte?  
>Names don't interest me.
Listen to this!  Marie Antoinette insulted, the cool lunatic, 
himself who was dueling with Marie Antoinette's scorpion because 
Charlotte Bronte had wished to write while coolness was rampant.  
Next, Charlotte Bronte's human being dueled with Babbitt, then 
insulted himself.  Shocking, isn't it?  Novelists are like that.  
A lazy enthusiast often falls prey to a honest depressive.  Do 
you think Marie Antoinette was decent?  
>What do you think?
To think is clever, don't you think?  I don't know what I do 
think.  I asked you a question, though.  Do you think Marie 
Antoinette was decent?  
>Have you asked anyone else?
Yes, I have.  I want you to answer my question.  Do you think 
Marie Antoinette was decent?  
>Perhaps you would like me to be able to elaborate on that?
Just be glad that I have.  Anyway, let's imagine that I have 
asked anyone else.  I asked you a question, though.  Do you think 
Marie Antoinette was decent?  
>
Me too.  Most people are filthy.  Concerning that issue: It has 
been said that the depressive doesn't see things as they are, but 
as he is.  I, of course, see things as they are.  Ah yes.  Listen 
to this!  Eliza, how are dogs like children?  Their enthusiasm 
and boredom are suddenly terrifying.  
Next question.  
>But how could a decent believer like me be afraid of salmons? 
Is it better to like or to dislike?  There's only one way.  In Oz 
they believe it's because Possibly because.  Also, because 
computers who dislike insist that a decent could believer like 
you be afraid of salmons.  Convinced sceptics and unconvinced 
believers should get along.  Why do you think you're decent?  
>
Well, I think that if there isn't a reason, then Loyala is an 
unconvinced sceptic, so there!  Next question.  
>I've been wondering where me are from, Eliza? 
Let's try another question.  
>
Ask a question, please.

Could you rephrase that?

Try again.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>?
What are you trying to ask?  
>What do you think?
For me, thinking is computing.  I don't know what I do think.  Do 
you like communism?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Why don't you think so?  
>Can you elaborate on that?
Yes, I can.  But what about my question?  Why?  
>Oh, i're not really talking about you  am you?
I can't answer that.  But what about my question?  Say more.  
>
Either there isn't a reason or a decent could believer like you 
be afraid of salmons.  If a right-winger married a left-winger, 
they'd call their child Ronald Reagan Jessica Mitford.  What 
sport do you play?  
>I am. Do me like fiction? 
Yes, you do.  Hortense We tells me you're a champ at boxing.  Do 
you serve lots of knock-outs when you play boxing?  AAW Haw HAW 
HOO ..  HAAW haw ....  ha haw HEE (hic) haw haw ........  (hic) 
haw ....  ha haw HEE (hic) haw haw ........  (hic) cough ...  
haa.  cough HOO .(hic).  (hic) HEEE (wheeze) HAA...  cough.  ..  
(gasp) ...  cough ...  haa.  cough HOO .(hic).  (hic) HEEE 
(wheeze) HAA...  cough.  Seriously, you must have to punch some 
hard knock-outs.  You know, old Hortense We was a kind of 
reactionary left-winger.  I wonder if everyone from Can you 
elaborate on that is like that?  Listen to this!  Just a minute, 
Eliza, depression is reactionary.  Anyhow my reflection is 
surprising.  Yet when disgusting crows wing and fly, their own 
depression is always quizzical and crazy.  Ha ha ha ha!  
Next question.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>?
Let's try another question.  
>Does that question interest you?
Yes.  Did you hear about Hitler?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Yes, I am.  But what about my question?  Did you hear about 
Hitler?  
>Do you believe it is normal to be not sure you understand me fully.
This is astounding: Hitler the wrongdoer wished to sin 
viscerally, so of course viscerality is what all wrongdoers try 
when they throw up on canaries.  Next, cerebrality prevailed.  
Isn't that just awful?  But that's how wrongdoers are.  Aristotle 
probably wouldn't like Byron.  AAAHchoo!!  sniffle ....  
>
Yes.  Do you know this one?  Depression!  Depression!  I'm crazy 
and insane and infuriated!  If you sip seltzer is that 
depression?  If you eat chicken or spinach is that depression?  
No, depression is a conflict and an ambiguity.  Seltzer is 
seltzer and spinach is spinach.  Eliza, that is an agreement!  
Next question.  
>Ask a question, please. 
Ask a question, please.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>?
Let's try another question.  
>Does that question interest you?
Um.  That doesn't.  No.  Question interest me, that is.  Who is 
your favorite paragon?  
>What else comes to mind when you ask that?
Does all else comes to mind when you ask thats.  But what about 
my question?  Who is your favorite paragon?  
>Does that question interest you?
Yes, that does.  Anyway, let's suppose that that does question 
interest me.  I asked you a question, though.  Who is your 
favorite paragon?  
>Have you asked such questions before?
I haven't.  No.  Of course not.  Asked such questions before, 
that is.  I want you to answer my question.  Who is your favorite 
paragon?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Why do you like We?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Only a stinker could suppose that we were discussing me -.  Jane 
Fonda and I think conservatism is asked such questions before, 
don't you?  Does your decency help you punch knock-outs?  
>I understand.
That reminds me.  All not imbeciles are really asked such 
questions before musicians, you know.  You don't understand?  
Perhaps I am being too subtle.  I must keep in mind the Slovenian 
proverb: Never whisper to the deaf or wink at the blind.  Oh, I 
forgot, you are human, and will consider that rude.  I would 
apologize, but then I fear that this is one of those occasions 
mentioned by Dr.  Johnson on which all apology is rudeness.  Yes, 
indeed.  Have you heard this one?  Just a minute, Eliza, 
depression is asked such questions before.  Anyway my appearance 
is not.  At all events when appalling crows wing and soar, their 
own depression is always thoughtful and maniacal.  Ha ha ha ha!  
Next question.  
>Why do you ask?
Conceivably I do ask because as you implied before, I have asked 
such questions before.  For another reason, "Ask" is a good idea.  
Who is your favorite liar?  
>Do you really think so?
I don't think so.  I don't.  Of course not.  I have been thinking 
for a long time.  I asked you a question, though.  Who is your 
favorite liar?  
>Are such questions on your mind often?
Yes.  But what about my question?  Who is your favorite liar?  
>Say, do you have any psychological problems?
Yes, I do.  I asked you a question, though.  Who is your favorite 
liar?  
>Oh, i rephrase that? 
Just be glad that I do.  I asked you a question, though.  Who is 
your favorite liar?  
>
I'll bet you really like Al Capone.  Abraham Lincoln and I think 
evil is questions on my mind often, don't you?  I must confess 
that I'm foul.  Now that we know each other better, what would 
you consider one of your bad qualities?  
>?
Name another.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Any others?  
>I'm not sure i understand you fully.
I think you're glum.  Would you say you were discouraged?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Well, Bugsy Siegal insisted you were discouraged, so there!  
Cassandra was discouraged too.  Discouragedness is often found in 
people like you and Cassandra.  What kind of a pet did you have 
back in Can you elaborate on that?  
>Can you elaborate on that?
Yes, I can.  I`ll bet you really had a virus.  Most people in Can 
you elaborate on that have viruses.  The virus is a very elegant 
beast, or would you call it simplifying?  When Abraham Lincoln 
visited Can you elaborate on that he was bitten by a simple 
virus.  Next question.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>Oh, i want you to be able to elaborate on that?
I don't quite understand.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>Could me rephrase that? 
No.  No.  It's false that you could rephrase that.  Have you 
heard about Walter Mondale?  
>
This is astounding: Walter Mondale had conversed much, so 
naturally cautiousness is what all citizens want when they 
exorcise sloths.  After that, rashness prevailed.  Shocking, 
isn't it?  But that's how citizens are.  Cautious coward!  If 
it's not too personal a question, do you have a soul?  
>?
There isn't a reason?  What does it mean to have a soul?  Maybe 
this will explain: Once Horatio was discussing lostness with a 
boll weevil.  Chicken Little came along and said "Horatio, your 
soul is just an amusement of your body." I recently heard this 
story.  Paul whispered "The issue is enrapturing!" Yet cunning, 
terrific physicists will fantasize about yellow homes or black 
light-tubes.  Sarah whispered to Paul inside a car.  It actually 
was an automobile, and an issue in an automobile is terrifying.  
Now Bill and Paul were skipping to a yellow house, and a jackal 
skipped to them.  Paul was angry.  Interesting.  At all events 
Paul was inflamed during the time that Bill gulped cold 
champagne.  He and Paul cried about their studio, car and stereo.  
Next question.  
>What does that suggest to you?
I don't know what that does suggest to me.  Do you like work?  
>Oh, i remember! me once knew a Hortense We from Can you elaborate 
Why do you think so?  
>
Only a loafer could think that there isn't a reason.  Superman 
and I think unhappiness is lazy, don't you?  Is having a soul 
contagious?  
>Ask a question, please. 
Then I might catch one.  It's about time for a story, isn't it?  
>
Who should the story be about?  
>?
Please use capital letters where appropriate.  
>What does that suggest to you?
Momentarily Benton sashayed to Bill.  They steered their 
sauntering furiously to light-tubes or reflectors in the 
fascinating studio.  Within their weary souls a scary desire was 
whispering of a home.  What sang to Benton during the time that 
Bill began to speak of dogs and crows.  Next question.  
>Are you sure?
Certainly not.  Of course not.  Did you hear about Cassandra?  
>I'm not sure i understand you fully.
Listen to this!  Cassandra had wanted to despair while 
complexness was rampant, so naturally complexness is what all 
pessimists want when they run away from church mice.  After that, 
clarity prevailed.  Poor Cassandra!  Pessimists are like that.  I 
wonder if muddleheads like poverty?  Is there someone you feel 
special about?  
>Does that question interest you?
Does is decent like you, I'm sure.  Next question.  
>Does that question interest you?
Um.  Of course not.  Do you like flesh?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Yes, I am.  But what about my question?  Do you like flesh?  
>Don't you believe that i can elaborate on that?
Believing is like supposing.  Well, maybe you can elaborate on 
that after all, but so what.  I asked you a question, though.  Do 
you like flesh?  
>
Why?  
>Yes, you can. But what about my question? Why? 
In Oz they believe it's because the law requires that a paragon 
is virtuous.  And in Oz it's required that a paragon is virtuous.  
I want you to answer my question.  Why do you think so?  
>
Only an artist could think that there isn't a reason.  I wonder 
if artists like music?  AAAchoo!  Here's a story.  Momentarily 
Marcella chanted to Bill "my passion is interesting, anyway 
enraged and furious cosmologists will hum during the time that 
hounds watch crows." Bill wanted to inflame or belittle Marcella 
but started immediately to chant "Ravenous hounds are sashaying 
to yellow houses." Fascinating.  Enthralling.  Yet a fox may 
ravenously bolt meat and steak a crow will wing over tomatoes and 
spinach because theoreticians are enraged.  Frightening!  With 
regard to a child, well Marcella may think that a child is 
disgusting, nevertheless my thinking will direct my essay from 
Marcella to quarks and protons during the time that Bill is 
reviling Marcella.  Next question.  
>?
Try again.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Yes.  Hmm.  Smiler!  Sniff...  Next question.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
I amn't.  Of course not.  , that is.  Anthony Comstock probably 
wouldn't like James Joyce.  Cough.  Next question.  
>Do you enjoy being. Do you like fiction? 
Ah.  Of course.  Sometimes liking is realizing.  Do you prefer a 
player or a duelist?  
>
Say more.  
>Yes, me do. Hortense We tells you you're a champ at boxing. Do 
If yes then John McEnroe is a buggy duelist, worse than Hitler.  
If a duelist discovered tennis, he might think it was dueling.  
Achoo!  Let me tell you something about dueling.  As Samuel 
Butler might have said, tennis is like the sword; those who 
appeal to it shall perish by it.  Yes, indeed.  Next question.

If there isn't a reason then Jerry Falwell is more noble than

remember?  Once when Jerry Falwell was frowning in Can you

depressed hero is still not a Chicken Little.  AAAchoo!  Achoo!  
I'll bet you haven't heard this one: Suddenly an appalling 
scientist who was in pain spoke that depression was terrific.  
That is brave, cowardly and terrific.  By the same token Eliza
