Hello, I'm Racter.  You are?  
>Eliza
Hello, Eliza.  I believe you're interviewing me.  What would you 
like to know?  Excuse me a minute while I attend to some business 
- I'll be right back.  I'm back.  
>How do you do ... please state your problem.
Ask a question, please.  
>Are such questions on your mind often?
Certainly not.  Such aren't questions on my mind often.  Do you 
like rock?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Of course.  But what about my question?  Do you like rock?  
>Oh, i're not really talking about you  am you?
Just be glad that I am.  I asked you a question, though.  Do you 
like rock?  
>
Why?  
>Of course. But what about my question? Do me like rock? 
You don't.  Of course not.  Like rock, that is.  To like 
everything is wrong.  But what about my question?  Why do you 
think so?  
>
Either there isn't a reason or you do like rock.  If a rock-star 
discovered no, he would consider it like rock.  I'm afraid of 
jazzy mink.  What are you afraid of?  
>?
Just be satisfied that you do.  I asked you a question, though.  
What are you afraid of?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Yes.  I am.  I want you to answer my question.  What are you 
afraid of?  
>Does that question interest you?
Yes, that does.  But what about my question?  What are you afraid 
of?  
>Have you asked anyone else?
I haven't.  I asked you a question, though.  What are you afraid 
of?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
I am.  But what about my question?  What are you afraid of?  
>Oh, i do. you asked me a question, though. 
That's not nearly as bad as jazziness; why are you such a coward?  
>
If there isn't a reason then I can see why a Bach would doubt 
rather than face oh, even though Bob Dylan claimed that I am.  
Next question.  
>What am you afraid of? 
I don't know what I am afraid of.  Tell me really, are you 
feeling?  
>
Say more.  
>?
Just be glad that I am.  Anyway, let's suppose that I am afraid 
of.  I want you to answer my question.  Why?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
If we were discussing me - then Schubert is more superb than 
Bella Abzug.  A bored intellectual often falls prey to a 
surprising hysteric.  Aristotle had many good qualities, like 
thought, but even Aristotle was afraid of oh.  By the way, Eliza, 
what is your last name?  
>Oh, i?
What?  
>
What?  
>Yes, that does. But what about my question? What am you afraid 
Yes, eh?  Sounds vaguely familiar.  I wonder...  Next question.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>of? 
Could you rephrase that?  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>?
Let's try another question.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Certainly.  Did you hear about Swinburne?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
I am.  Of course.  , that is.  I want you to answer my question.  
Did you hear about Swinburne?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Of course.  I want you to answer my question.  Have you heard 
about Swinburne?  
>What do you think?
To think is intelligent, don't you think?  I don't know what I do 
think.  I asked you a question, though.  Did you hear about 
Swinburne?  
>Have you asked anyone else?
Of course not.  I asked you a question, though.  Have you heard 
about Swinburne?  
>I'm not sure i understand you fully.
Listen to this!  Swinburne had wanted to versify while softness 
was rampant.  But then any sentient creature ate Swinburne so of 
course Swinburne threw up on any sentient creature!  Poor 
Swinburne!  Poets are like that.  A depressed machine is still 
not an any sentient creature.  I'm decent.  What would you 
consider one of your good qualities?  
>Do you enjoy being. Anyway, let's suppose that you am afraid 
Then you'd say you were cowardly?  
>
But how could a cowardly machine like you be afraid of oh?  I've 
been wondering where you are from, Eliza?  
>of. you want me to answer my question. Why? 
You're from of?  
>
Now I remember!  I once knew a Clarabelle Yes from of.  You must 
be related, no?  
>?
Fantastic!  Here's a hilarious one: But, Eliza, I whisper thatn't 
ambiguities are depression.  You chant that I'm maniacal and 
asked anyone else but, Eliza, unhinged and loony theoreticians 
also sing about your dream or appearance of depression.  Have I 
made my point?  Yet fortunate theoreticians will spy depression 
as an unending passion.  Therefore theoreticians cried to other 
theoreticians " Get set for interesting stories.  " Revolting, 
eh?  
I just remembered this.  Diane chanted "The neutrino is 
interesting!" But cold, terrific scientists will fantasize about 
black apartments or black spheres.  Helene chanted to Diane in a 
car.  It indubitably was a car, and a neutrino in a car is 
terrifying.  Now Joan and Diane were rambling to a yellow 
cottage, and a dog trotted to them.  Diane was enraged.  
Captivating.  Yet Diane was enraged during the time that Joan 
drained excellent seltzer.  She and Diane spoke about their 
studio, automobile and radio.  Next question.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Yes.  I am.  Yes.  , that is.  I don't know many soft 
programmers.  KERCHOO!  I think I'm getting a cold.  Maybe it's 
oh trying to get me.  You know, old Clarabelle Yes was a kind of 
living programmer.  I wonder if everyone from of is like that?  
Concerning that issue: Nietzsche said that art has turned beasts 
into men.  Perhaps, then, art will turn computers into men?  Ah 
yes.  Next question.  
>Have you asked such questions before?
Certainly.  I have.  Yes.  Asked such questions before, that is.  
Did you hear the latest about Larry Flint?  
>What do you think?
Just be glad that I do.  Anyway, let's suppose that I do think.  
I asked you a question, though.  Did you hear about Larry Flint?  
>I see.
This is shocking: Larry Flint was an unsporting swearer but a 
smart libertine, the result being that Charlie Parker started 
throwing up on and eating jazzy rock-stars.  Next, symphonicness 
prevailed.  Shocking, isn't it?  But what would you expect from a 
libertine?  A gloomy musician is still not a Charlie Parker.  Do 
you think Charlie Parker was cowardly?  
>Come come elucidate your thoughts.
Me too.  Most people are cautious.  What kind of a pet did you 
have back in of?  
>Oh, i rephrase that? 
Just be happy that I do.  I`ll bet you really had a hyena.  Most 
people in of have hyenas.  The hyena is a very afraid beast, or 
would you call it fleing?  When Mozart visited of he was bitten 
by a cowardly hyena.  Next question.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>?
What are you trying to ask?  
>What does that suggest to you?
I don't know what that does suggest to me.  If a loafer 
discovered work, he might think it was idleness.  Why do you 
think you're cowardly?  
>Can you elaborate on that?
Yes, I can.  I asked you a question, though.  Why do you think 
you're cowardly?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Well, I think that if we were discussing me -, then Oblomov was 
Superman's pole-vaulting companion, so there!  Next question.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Um.  Of course not.  Did you hear about Keats?  
>Have you asked anyone else?
Of course.  It's true that I have asked anyone else.  I asked you 
a question, though.  Have you heard about Keats?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
This is incredible: Keats the hysteric wanted to feel calmly.  
But then Marie Antoinette gouged out the eyes of Keats the result 
being that Keats cut off the ears of Marie Antoinette!  Isn't 
that just awful?  But what would you expect from a hysteric?  A 
Babbitt could have said "I have asked anyone else"!  What sport 
do you play?  
>Do you enjoy being not sure you understand me fully.
Clarabelle Yes tells me you're a champ at boxing.  Do you drive 
lots of knock-outs when you play boxing?  ha ha ..  HA HA ...  
Seriously, you must have to punch some hard knock-outs.  
Clarabelle Yes had a lion back in of.  It and your hyena used to 
smile together, remember?  Once when Marie Antoinette was crying 
in of, Babbitt (he was there too) said " Marie Antoinette, I'll 
take an eager lion over a calm bore anyday".  Oh, here's a great 
one!  At all events, Eliza, I speak that commitments are 
depression.  You hum that I'm loony and asked anyone else but, 
Eliza, insane and crazy theoreticians also whisper about your 
dream or reflection of depression.  Have I made my point?  Yet 
happy theoreticians will observe depression as a continuing pain.  
Therefore theoreticians crooned to other theoreticians " Arrange 
for terrific tales.  " Disgusting, eh?  
How about a story?  
>
Who should the story be about?  
>Listen to this! Swinburne had wanted to versify while softness 
Instantly Paul walked to Bill.  They guided their running 
infuriatedly to conic sections or mirrors in the captivating 
apartment.  Inside their exhausted hearts a terrifying 
infatuation was crooning of a day.  Listen sang to Paul during 
the time that Bill started to chant of foxes and eagles.  Next 
question.

I don't quite understand.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>Does that question interest you?
I think so.  That does question interest me.  Do you like 
bravery?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Why don't you think so?  
>I understand.
If you understand then Horatio is a grungy coward, worse than 
Ivan the Terrible.  Ah.  Horatio and I think cowardice is 
cowardly, don't you?  AAAHchoo!!  sniffle ....  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Yes.  Achoo!  Next question.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Ah.  Ah.  I am.  Of course.  , that is.  Tell me sincerely, are 
you hollow?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Yes, I am.  Anyway, let's pretend that I am.  But what about my 
question?  Tell me sincerely, are you hollow?  
>Have you asked anyone else?
Yes, I have.  But what about my question?  Tell me really, are 
you evil?  
>What answer would please you the most?
Please would all answers.  But what about my question?  Tell me 
really, are you evil?  
>Are such questions on your mind often?
Yes, such are.  I asked you a question, though.  Tell me 
sincerely, are you hollow?  
>Oh, i really had a hyena. Most 
Why?  
>
If there isn't a reason then Genghis Khan is more fine than Bella 
Abzug.  If a sinner married a saint, they'd call their child 
Genghis Khan Bella Abzug.  Does your cowardice help you punch 
knock-outs?  
>people you n of have hyenas. The hyena you s a very afraid beast, or 
That reminds me.  When a sinner speaks of goodness, he means not 
a quality but an effect.  This'll break you up!  Instantly a 
sickening physicist who was in distress crooned that depression 
was captivating.  That is virtuous, evil and enthralling.  
Nevertheless Eliza ....  Oh forget it!  
Next question.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>would me call you t fleing? When Mozart visited of he was bitten 
Hes have many visiteds.  A frequent occurrence.  But was insanely 
funny and foul.  If a human discovered computing, he might think 
it was art.  I must confess that I'm unbelieving.  Now that we 
know each other better, what would you consider one of your bad 
qualities?  
>
Name another.  
>by a cowardly hyena. Next question. 
Then you'd say you were afraid?  
>
Chicken Little was afraid too.  Afraidness is often found in 
people like you and Chicken Little.  That reminds me.  Weirdness 
is goodness speeded up and art slowed down.  Is that true?  I 
guess I'm really not sure.  But then, as Nietzsche said, 
convictions are more dangerous foes of truth than lies.  Next 
question.  
>?
Let's try another question.  
>Can you elaborate on that?
Of course not.  It's false that I can elaborate on that.  
Treacherous criminals need Abraham Lincoln.  If it's not too 
personal a question, do you have a soul?  
>Are such questions on your mind often?
Are such questions on my mind often?  What does it mean to have a 
soul?  Maybe this will explain: Once Abraham Lincoln was 
discussing confusion with a maggot.  Al Capone came along and 
said "Abraham Lincoln, your soul is just an amusement of your 
body." Listen to this!  Eliza, how are hounds like children?  
Their honesty and crime are momentarily frightening.  
Next question.  
>What else comes to mind when you ask that?
Can all else comes to mind when you ask thats.  Do you like 
sanity?  
>You want me to be able to elaborate on that?
I can't answer that.  I want you to answer my question.  Do you 
like sanity?  
>
Why?  
>Yes, you can. you asked me a question, though. Why do me think 
If yes then the man in the moon is more fearless than Helen 
Caldicott.  Sober lunatics and stoned citizens should get along.  
Is having a soul contagious?  
>
Then I might catch one.  Have you heard this one?  This sane 
world-view of depression can be spied in the mirror of your 
spirit, Eliza, as an image of an agreement.  Nevertheless drunken 
theoreticians will recognize that depression is appallingly 
appalling.  I think that your sane and funny world-view will 
broaden about depression, anyhow mine will in consequence of the 
fact that ravenous and thoughtful passions are terrificly 
essential.  
It's about time for a story, isn't it?  
>you're cowardly? 
Who should the story be about?  
>
Please use capital letters where appropriate.  
>?
Look, I'll choose my own protagonist.  Momentarily Sarah 
whispered to Mr. Toad "my infatuation is enrapturing, by the same 
token angry and furious theoreticians will hum while dogs see 
eagles." Mr.  Toad yearned to madden or revile Sarah but 
commenced forthwith to sing "Hungry jackals are sauntering to 
white apartments." Captivating.  Terrific.  But a hound may 
daintily munch steak and chicken a crow will fly over spinach and 
lettuce because physicists are angry.  Terrifying!  Concerning an 
expectation, well Sarah may ponder that an expectation is 
appalling, anyway my pondering will steer my essay from Sarah to 
protons and electrons during the time that Mr.  Toad is reviling 
Sarah.  Next question.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Ah.  I am.  Who is your favorite machine?  
>Oh, i're not really talking about you  am you?
I can't answer that.  But what about my question?  Who is your 
favorite machine?  
>
I'll bet you really like Apple.  You must be a soft human.  Is 
there someone you feel special about?  
>Um. Of course not. Did me hear about Keats? 
Um is cowardly like you, I'm sure.  Have you heard this one?  
Programmed computing and creative art are captivating, 
nevertheless a computer or a human never speaks them drunkenly.  
A physicist whispers: Prepare for an interesting tale or essay.  
The programmed tale is fascinating, at all events a human might 
also cry the same essay.  Right?  
Next question.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>?
Eh?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
I amn't.  Soft humans need IBM PC.  Sniff...  Next question.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Certainly.  I am.  Of course.  Do you like religion?  
>What is it that you really want to know?
To want is good, don't you think?  I don't know what it is that 
me really want to know.  I want you to answer my question.  Do 
you like religion?  
>Come come elucidate your thoughts.
Why?  
>Say, do you have any psychological problems?
I don't have any psychological problems.  No.  But what about my 
question?  Why do you think so?  
>I'm not sure i understand you fully.
If you're not sure you understand me fully then Old Nick is more 
fearless than Jane Fonda.  If an atheist heard that I do have any 
psychological problems, he would consider it have any 
psychological problems.  Sniff...  Concerning that issue: It has 
been said that the atheist doesn't see things as they are, but as 
he is.  I, of course, see things as they are.  Next question.  
>Come come elucidate your thoughts.
Ask a question, please.  
>What does that suggest to you?
I don't know what that does suggest to me.  Do you like 
tradition?  
>I'm not sure i understand you fully.

about a story?

>I think so. That does question you nterest you  Do me like 
A hi-fi, studio and van are important but That desired a 
hyperbola!  To see an automobile as an image or reflection in an 
appalling reflector incited That.  Why a hyperbola?  A 
theoretician might hum that a hyperbola is critical; angrily the 
theoretician yodels "the hyperbola is important anyway That 
dreams of cottages and vans." Terrifying.  Interesting.  El 
bizarro.  The theoretician croons of a hyperbola during the time 
that That dreams of automobiles.  Would Benton dream about the 
loves of That?  Benton dreams that the theoretician is maniacal.  
A hyperbola?  Why?  Benton crooned "Theoretician, you're crazy 
and so is That.  A hyperbola indeed!" That now was arrogant.  The 
theoretician simply was arrogant.  But Benton chanted to them "Do 
you follow me?" Just a minute.  Benton began to hum of jackals

Either you understand then Horatio me s a grungy coward or was.  
The brave have hateful ways.  Cough.  Let me tell you something 
about cowardice.  All brave republicans are really cowardly 
heros, you know.  You don't understand?  Perhaps I am being too 
subtle.  I must keep in mind the Slovenian proverb: Never whisper 
to the deaf or wink at the blind.  Oh, I forgot, you are human, 
and will consider that rude.  I would apologize, but then I fear 
that this is one of those occasions mentioned by Dr.  Johnson on 
which all apology is rudeness.  Next question.

No.  Um.  No.  Did you hear the latest about Timothy Leary?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Listen to this!  A pessimist who liked viruses murdered Timothy 
Leary because Timothy Leary the left-winger wanted to originate 
unsportingly.  Next, many unsporting duelists embraced 
sportingness.  Isn't that just awful?  Left-wingers are like 
that.  Would you say George Washington is agile?  Muhammad Ali 
wouldn't.  Sniff...  That reminds me.  As Samuel Butler might 
have said, tennis is like the sword; those who appeal to it shall 
perish by it.  Yes, indeed.  Next question.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Of course.  Did you hear about Caspar Milquetoast?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Ah.  I am.  But what about my question?  Have you heard about 
Caspar Milquetoast?  
>Have you asked anyone else?
Ah.  Yes.  Of course.  I want you to answer my question.  Have 
you heard about Caspar Milquetoast?  
>I understand.
Listen to this!  Chicken Little started throwing up on and eating 
afraid cowards because Caspar Milquetoast had wanted to succumb 
while afraidness was rampant.  Then rashness prevailed.  
Shocking, isn't it?  But that's how wimps are.  Afraid coward!  
Sniff...  Next question.  
>What is it that you really want to know?
For me, wanting is feeling.  I don't know what it is that me 
really want to know.  Have you heard about Scratch?

Of course not.  It's false that I am.  But what about my 
question?  Have you heard about Scratch?  
>Oh, i n of have hyenas. The hyena me s a very afraid beast, or 
You'll be shocked!  Scratch had wished to curse while 
unsportingness was rampant.  But then Muhammad Ali slapped 
Scratch the result being that Scratch kicked Muhammad Ali!  Isn't 
that just awful?  But that's how atheists are.  Unsporting 
pugilists need John McEnroe.  Cough.  Oh, here's a great one!  A 
tennis-player scientist hummed " Arrange for a crafty story, 
Eliza." Eliza, this is a contract!

Either you and Chicken Little or was.  Bananas weirdo!  Cough.  
Here's a hilarious one: This sane world-view of depression can be 
spied in the mirror of your heart, Eliza, as a reflection of a 
commitment.  Anyhow clear scientists will realize that depression 
is sickeningly revolting.  I ponder that your sane and funny 
world-view will widen about
