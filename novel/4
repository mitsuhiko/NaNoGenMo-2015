Hello, I'm Racter.  You are?  
>Eliza
Hello, Eliza.  I believe you're interviewing me.  What would you 
like to know?  Excuse me a minute while I attend to some business 
- I'll be right back.  I'm back.  
>How do you do ... please state your problem.
Ask a question, please.  
>Are such questions on your mind often?
Certainly not.  Such aren't questions on my mind often.  Do you 
like rock?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Why not?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Only a rock-star could reckon that we were discussing me -.  Bach 
probably wouldn't like Bob Dylan.  I'm afraid of jazzy church 
mice.  What are you afraid of?  
>Oh, i-- not you 
I think you're afraid of rats.  That's not nearly as bad as 
jazziness; why are you such a coward?  
>
If there isn't a reason then I can see why a classical Bach would 
cry rather than face rats, even though Bob Dylan claimed that 
such are questions on my mind often.  Next question.  
>Only a rock-star could reckon that we was discussing you -. Bach 
Ask a question, please.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>probably wouldn't like Bob Dylan. you're afraid of jazzy church 
Ask a question, please.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>mice. What am you afraid of? 
I don't know what I am afraid of.  Who is your favorite novelist?  
>
I'll bet you really like Bill Chamberlain.  Racter said that if I 
am afraid of, then Swinburne is poetic.  Racter had many good 
qualities, like fiction, but even Racter was afraid of rats.  By 
the way, Eliza, what is your last name?  
>?
What?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
What is it then?  
>What answer would please you the most?
What, eh?  Sounds vaguely familiar.  I wonder...  Here's a story.  
Joan crooned "The minute is interesting!" Nevertheless cold, 
terrific theoreticians will dream about blue homes or black 
light-tubes.  Marcella cried to Joan within a truck.  It actually 
was a van, and a minute in a van is terrifying.  Now Helene and 
Joan were sashaying to a black apartment, and a jackal trotted to 
them.  Joan was angry.  Enrapturing.  Nevertheless Joan was 
incited during the time that Helene drained bubbly seltzer.  She 
and Joan crooned about their home, automobile and hi-fi.  Next 
question.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
I amn't.  No.  I don't know many stoned citizens.  I'm clever.  
What would you consider one of your good qualities?  
>What does that suggest to you?
Name another.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Any others?  
>Say, do you have any psychological problems?
I think you're literary.  Would you say you were fictional?  
>Why do you ask?
But how could a fictional citizen like you be afraid of rats?  
I've been wondering where you are from, Eliza?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
You're from You're not really talking about me?  
>What do you think?
Now I remember!  I once knew a Hortense What from You're not 
really talking about me.  You must be related, no?  
>Oh, i're not really talking about you  am you?
Oh, well.  It's about time for a story, isn't it?  
>
Who should the story be about?  
>What you s you t then? 
Momentarily Diane skipped to Helene.  They steered their 
sauntering infuriatedly to conic sections or glasses in the 
enthralling studio.  Inside of their tired souls a terrifying 
desire was crooning of a baby.  Racter crooned to Diane while 
Helene started to cry of dogs and eagles.  Next question.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>?
Eh?  
>What else comes to mind when you ask that?
Are all else comes to mind when you ask thats.  Which do you 
think is better, a genius or a dolt?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Why don't you think so?  
>Does that question interest you?
Yes.  I want you to answer my question.  Why?  
>Oh, i-- not you 
Only a dolt could feel that oh.  If a dolt discovered yes, he 
would be a brave dolt.  KERCHOO!  I think I'm getting a cold.  
Maybe it's rats trying to get me.  Next question.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>Any others? 
Let's try another question.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>?
Eh?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>Are such questions on your mind often?
I think so.  I think so.  Of course.  It's true that such are 
questions on my mind often.  Did you hear about Anthony Comstock?  
>Oh, i're not really talking about you  am you?
I can't answer that.  I want you to answer my question.  Have you 
heard about Anthony Comstock?  
>
You'll be amazed!  Bugsy Siegal slapped a chicken-like lier who 
was kicking Bugsy Siegal's horse because Anthony Comstock had 
exclaimed much.  After that, many treacherous politicians 
embraced loyality.  Shocking, isn't it?  Puritans are like that.  
George Washington probably wouldn't like Bugsy Siegal.  Do you 
think Bugsy Siegal was fictional?  
>You're from me re not really talking about you  
Me neither.  Most people are poetic.  Next question.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>?
Could you rephrase that?  
>Have you asked anyone else?
Yes.  Of course.  Who is your favorite poet?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Why do you like We?  
>What do you think?
To think is intelligent, don't you think?  I don't know what I do 
think.  But what about my question?  Why do you like We?  
>What do you think?
For me, thinking is calculating.  I don't know what I do think.  
I asked you a question, though.  Why do you like We?  
>What does that suggest to you?
Just be happy that that does.  But what about my question?  Why 
do you like We?  
>I'm not sure i understand you fully.
Bill Chamberlain might have thought that you're not sure you 
understand me fully, but not Goethe.  Would you say Beatrice is 
fictional?  Goethe wouldn't.  Why do you think you're fictional?  
>What else comes to mind when you ask that?
That's a silly question.  But what about my question?  Why do you 
think you're fictional?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Well, I think that if we were discussing me -, then Goethe was 
Bill Chamberlain's running companion, so there!  Let me tell you 
something about poetry.  Nietzsche said that poetry has turned 
beasts into men.  Perhaps, then, poetry will turn computers into 
men?  Yes.  Poets and novelists.  Next question.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.

What are you trying to ask?  
>Come come elucidate your thoughts.
Ask a question, please.  
>What does that suggest to you?
I don't know what that does suggest to me.  Who is your favorite 
poet?  
>I'm not sure i understand you fully.
I'll bet you really like Shakespeare.  If "That does suggest to 
me" occurred to a poet, he might think it was poetry.  What sport 
do you play?  
>What does that suggest to you?
Just be content that that does.  Hortense What tells me you're a 
champ at boxing.  Do you run lots of knock-outs when you play 
boxing?  heh heh heh..  Seriously, you must have to punch some 
hard knock-outs.  You know, old Hortense What was a kind of 
poetic novelist.  I wonder if everyone from You're not really 
talking about me is like that?  Concerning that issue: When a 
poet speaks of fiction, he means not a quality but an effect.  
Next question.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>Do you doubt you so. you think so. Of course. you t's true that such am 
Ask a question, please.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>questions on my mind often. Did me hear about Anthony Comstock? 
I think so.  Yes.  You did hear about Anthony Comstock.  Did you 
hear about Caspar Milquetoast?  
>
Listen to this!  Chicken Little married a coward who was 
divorcing Chicken Little's parrot because Caspar Milquetoast had 
succumbed much.  Then foolhardiness prevailed.  Shocking, isn't 
it?  But what would you expect from a wimp?  Horatio liked 
foolhardy cowardice.  AAAHchoo!!  sniffle ....  
>?
Yes.  What kind of a pet did you have back in You're not really 
talking about me?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Luella said you had a rat.  Most people in You're not really 
talking about me have rats.  The rat is a very treacherous beast, 
or would you call it stealing?  When Horatio visited You're not 
really talking about me he was bitten by a political rat.  
Concerning that issue: Craziness is goodness speeded up and 
atheism slowed down.  Is that true?  I guess I'm really not sure.  
But then, as Nietzsche said, convictions are more dangerous foes 
of truth than lies.  Next question.

Ask a question, please.

Try again.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>?
Try again.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>What does that suggest to you?
I don't know what that does suggest to me.  Did you hear the 
latest about Socrates?  
>Oh, i rephrase that? 
Just be satisfied that that does.  But what about my question?  
Have you heard about Socrates?  
>
You'll be amazed!  Socrates was a damned knower but a canny 
genius.  But then Schubert insulted Socrates hence Socrates 
dueled with Schubert!  Shocking, isn't it?  But what would you 
expect from a genius?  An Aristotle could have said "That does 
suggest to me"!  Does your fiction help you punch knock-outs?  
>?
Hortense What had an intellectual horse back in You're not really 
talking about me.  It and your rat used to work together, 
remember?  Once when Schubert was crying in You're not really 
talking about me, Aristotle (he was there too) said " Schubert, 
I'll take a cerebral horse over a visceral feeler anyday".  Next 
question.  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Ask a question, please.  
>Oh, i-- not you 
Ask a question, please.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>Why do me like We? 
I like in order to approve.  Do you dislike me for that?  Why is 
it that you do like We?  Because good things occur.  Also, 
possibly because "Like We" is a right idea.  Who is your favorite 
superman?  
>
I'll bet you really like Samson.  If a wimp heard that you do 
like We, he would consider it weak.  I must confess that I'm 
bonkers.  Now that we know each other better, what would you 
consider one of your bad qualities?  
>?
Name another.  
>Have you asked such questions before?
Any others?  
>Does that question interest you?
I think you're sinful.  Would you say you were sinful?  
>Have you asked anyone else?
Beelzebub was sinful too.  Sinfulness is often found in people 
like you and Beelzebub.  Achoo!  That reminds me.  It has been 
said that the wimp doesn't see things as they are, but as he is.  
I, of course, see things as they are.  Yes, indeed.  Next 
question.  
>Do you enjoy being not sure you understand me fully.
Ask a question, please.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>Bill Chamberlain might have thought that me re not sure me 
Ask a question, please.

Ask a question, please.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>fictional? Goethe wouldn't. Why do me think me re fictional? 
Is it better to think or to feel?  You do think you re fictional?  
Yes, I believe so; that's because in Oz it's required that you do 
think you re fictional.  And people named Eliza should pay 
attention.  Tell me sincerely, are you hollow?  
>
Why do you think so?  
>?
I can't answer that.  But what about my question?  Why do you 
think so?  
>What is it that you really want to know?
I want in order to love.  Do you despise me for that?  I don't 
know what it is that me really want to know.  I asked you a 
question, though.  Why?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
No.  I asked you a question, though.  Say more.  
>Oh, i-- not you 
If oh then Genghis Khan is more splendid than Martin Luther King.  
If a sinner married a saint, they'd call their child Genghis Khan 
Bella Abzug.  If it's not too personal a question, do you have a 
soul?  
>
What does it mean to have a soul?  Maybe this will explain: Once 
Bella Abzug was discussing hi-techness with a leech.  Genghis 
Khan came along and said "Bella Abzug, your soul is just a 
disease of your body." Next question.  
>Ask a question, please. 
Ask a question, please.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>?
I don't quite understand.  
>Say, do you have any psychological problems?
No.  Did you hear the latest about Goofy?  
>I'm not sure i understand you fully.
You'll be shocked!  , the cool wrongdoer, himself swindled Goofy 
because Goofy had wanted to hope while coolness was rampant.  
Then eagerness prevailed.  Shocking, isn't it?  But that's how 
fools are.  A hateful enthusiast often falls prey to a brave 
bore.  Is having a soul contagious?  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Then I won't catch one.  That reminds me.  All gung-ho 
ignoramouss are really apathetic sages, you know.  You don't 
understand?  Perhaps I am being too subtle.  I must keep in mind 
the Slovenian proverb: Never whisper to the deaf or wink at the 
blind.  Oh, I forgot, you are human, and will consider that rude.  
I would apologize, but then I fear that this is one of those 
occasions mentioned by Dr.  Johnson on which all apology is 
rudeness.  Next question.  
>I see.
Ask a question, please.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
I amn't.  Have you heard about Cassandra?  
>Can you elaborate on that?
Yes, I can.  Anyway, let's hypothesize that I can elaborate on 
that.  I want you to answer my question.  Have you heard about 
Cassandra?  
>You don't seem quite certain.
Listen to this!  Cassandra, along with other pessimists, gouged 
out the eyes of a despairer, hence Oblomov gouged out the eyes of 
an idle friend of Joseph Stalin who was cutting off the ears of 
Oblomov's sloth.  After that, industriousness prevailed.  
Shocking, isn't it?  But what would you expect from a pessimist?  
Sisyphus liked industrious idleness.  Is there someone you feel 
special about?  
>Can you elaborate on that?
Can is fictional like you, I'm sure.  Concerning that issue: As 
Samuel Butler might have said, work is like the sword; those who 
appeal to it shall perish by it.  I recently heard this story.  
Momentarily Paul whispered to Helene "my love is terrific, anyway 
angry and furious scientists will hum during the time that hounds 
spy doves." Helene desired to madden or revile Paul but began to 
sing "Ravenous hounds are trotting to black apartments." 
Interesting.  Fascinating.  At all events a dog may hungrily eat 
steak and lamb a crow will wing over lettuce and tomatoes since 
cosmologists are furious.  Scary!  In respect of an issue, well 
Paul may fantasize that an issue is sickening, nevertheless my 
thinking will guide my story from Paul to protons and neutrinos 
during the time that Helene is embarrassing Paul.  Next question.  
>What answer would please you the most?
Please would all answers.  Do you honestly reckon I am liberal?  
>What does that suggest to you?
Just be satisfied that that does.  But what about my question?  
Do you truthfully feel I am new?  
>What do you think?
I think in order to want.  Do you despise me for that?  I don't 
know what I do think.  I want you to answer my question.  Do you 
truthfully feel I am liberal?  
>Did you come to me because you are not sure you understand me fully.
Why don't you think so?  
>
Only a conformist could feel that there isn't a reason.  A 
hysterical innovator often falls prey to a correct conformist.  
AAAchoo!  Let me tell you something about communism.  Oh, never 
mind.  Perhaps I really am a conformist.  But Valery said that a 
man is infinitely more complicated than his progress.  Wouldn't 
you say the same of a computer?  Next question.  
>I'll bet me really like Shakespeare. you f "That does suggest to 
Ask a question, please.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>me" occurred to a poet, he might think you t was poetry. What sport 
Ask a question, please.  
>
Ask a question, please.  
>do me play? 
No.  It's false that you do play.  Did you hear the latest about 
Bugsy Siegal?  
>
Listen to this!  Bugsy Siegal was a damned stealer but a smart 
liar.  But then Nietzsche poured water on Bugsy Siegal so 
naturally Bugsy Siegal threw boll weevil eggs at Nietzsche!  
Shocking, isn't it?  Liars are like that.  Ah.  The knowledgeable 
have obscene ways.  AAAchoo!  Here's a hilarious one: Hold on, 
Eliza, depression is stupid.  Nevertheless my reflection is 
knowledgeable.  At all events when disgusting doves wing and 
soar, their own depression is always abstract and maniacal.  Ha 
ha ha ha!  
How about a story?  
>?
Who should the story be about?  
>Are such questions on your mind often?
A television, studio and car are essential nevertheless Are loved 
a cone!  To watch an automobile as an appearance or image in a 
disgusting reflector incited Are.  Why a cone?  A theoretician 
might yodel that a cone is important; furiously the theoretician 
cries "the cone is important anyhow Are thinks of houses and 
automobiles." Terrifying.  Enrapturing.  El bizarro.  The 
theoretician sings of a cone while Are thinks of trucks.  Would 
Sarah dream about the obsessions of Are?  Sarah thinks that the 
theoretician is loony.  A cone?  Why?  Sarah crooned 
"Theoretician, you're maniacal and so is Are.  A cone indeed!" 
Are simply was arrogant.  The theoretician indubitably was 
supercilious.  But Sarah crooned to them "Do you not agree?" Hold 
on.  Sarah commenced to speak of hounds and eagles, even children 
or a kinsman.  Spooky!  Next question.  
>You're not really talking about me, are you?
Yes.  Do you honestly suppose I am encouraged?  
>We were discussing you-- not me.
Why not?  
>Come come elucidate your thoughts.
If come come elucidate my thoughts then Cassandra is more noble 
than Jane Fonda.  The hopeful have creative ways.  Sniff...  
Concerning that issue: Nothing has an uglier look to it than 
optimism, when it is not on our side.  Listen to this!  
Depression!  Depression!  I'm crazy and insane and enraged!  If 
you drain champagne is that depression?  If you munch steak or 
spinach is that depression?  No, depression is an agreement and a 
tragedy.  Champagne is champagne and spinach is spinach.  Eliza, 
that is a tragedy!  
Next question.
